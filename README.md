# Price Compare (Project 1)

Product price comparison application

## Description

Compare online storefronts (e.g. Walmart and Amazon) to get the lowest price on the same product. Utilized full-stack skills and knowledge to build a price comparer web application from scratch. The team devise and produce a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.


The activities this week help familiarize moment.js library to work with date and time, jquery elements, UI widgets and interactions, click events, form elements, DOM traversal, event delegation, google fonts, bootstrap components, layout, utilities and extends.

## User Story

 We all want cheap products, but sometimes Amazon is not the lowest price out there. We need to use tools to find the best value for the products we want to buy. This tool narrows down our choices to give the user the lowest price around.
