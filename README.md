# Price Compare (Project 1)
Authors: Nathan Stein, Jay Autus, Javier Brizuela, Jinsa Sameer

The third party API service is NO LONGER being paid for. Please Contact Nathan Stein for questions regarding this project.
# About
This application will quickly grab the results you need from the world's largest retailers and deliver pricing information on the top products from these companies. The team utilized their full-stack skills and knowledge to build a price comparison web application from scratch. The goal was to solve a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

The team worked collaboratively and learned agile development methodologies, implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.


## User Story

Our users range from the everyday consumer who wants a clean and digestible format to view and compare similar products, to resellers and dropshippers who want to either sell or purchase inventory. 


## Usage

1. Once Price Compare page launches
2. Enter the search term in the input field
3. Select a store in each drop-down and shows the price, rating, shipping and manufacturer
4. Click search

# Future Plans

* Add graphs to show the last year's price fluctuations.  Perhaps a section to follow pricing trends and alert users to historical lows.
* Provide more than the current [0] index. Give more options.
* Utilize more store APIs to provide more data for the consumer. Alibaba, Wish, and more to truly provide all the relevant information to users.
* From a design standpoint, focus on mobile. Also, additional focus to put on providing a more seamless experience.
  -For example, after the call has been completeed, WHEN the store option in the dropdown is changed, THEN the information displayed also changes.
